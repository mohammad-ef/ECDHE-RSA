# ECDHE-RSA Java Implementation

The **ECDHE**(Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange) is anonymous key agreement scheme, which allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel[1]. And **RSA** (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptosystem widely used for secure data transmission.

There are implementations of two different digital signature algorithm (**DSA** and **ECDSA**) in this project. For using them, you can use the comment code in *ECDHE_RSADS* class.
